## Issue 1

**Date:** 2024-12-24
**Description:**  
I faced issue when running the ssh commands like uname using the while loop script.Below is the conversation with chatgpt

```
I want run this on multiple hosts one after another I have script as well but it's quits after first one
root@ip-172-31-57-156:/home/admin# while read IP FQDN HOST SUBNET; do    ssh -i azure-devops.pem admin@${IP} sudo uname -o -m; done < ./kubernetes-the-hard-way/machines.txt

The issue with your script quitting after processing the first host is likely due to the behavior of ssh. When ssh reads from the same stdin as your while loop, it consumes the input meant for the loop, causing the loop to terminate prematurely.

To fix this, you can redirect the stdin for ssh to /dev/null or use a file descriptor to avoid this conflict.

Here are some approaches to solve the issue:

1. Redirect ssh's Input
Modify your script to redirect ssh's stdin to /dev/null:

bash
Copy code
while read IP FQDN HOST SUBNET; do
    ssh -i azure-devops.pem admin@${IP} sudo uname -o -m </dev/null
done < ./kubernetes-the-hard-way/machines.txt
2. Use a File Descriptor
Use a file descriptor to handle the input file separately from the loop:

bash
Copy code
while read IP FQDN HOST SUBNET; do
    ssh -i azure-devops.pem admin@${IP} sudo uname -o -m
done 3< ./kubernetes-the-hard-way/machines.txt <&3
3. Use xargs for Parallel or Sequential Execution
You can use xargs to process the list in machines.txt sequentially or in parallel.

Sequential Execution:
bash
Copy code
cat ./kubernetes-the-hard-way/machines.txt | while read IP FQDN HOST SUBNET; do
    echo "$IP" | xargs -I{} ssh -i azure-devops.pem admin@{} sudo uname -o -m
done
Parallel Execution:
To run commands in parallel, you can use xargs with the -P flag:

bash
Copy code
cat ./kubernetes-the-hard-way/machines.txt | awk '{print $1}' | xargs -P 5 -I{} ssh -i azure-devops.pem admin@{} sudo uname -o -m
4. Debugging with set -x
If you're unsure about the cause of the issue, you can enable debugging in your script to trace command execution:

bash
Copy code
set -x
while read IP FQDN HOST SUBNET; do
    ssh -i azure-devops.pem admin@${IP} sudo uname -o -m </dev/null
done < ./kubernetes-the-hard-way/machines.txt
set +x
This will print each command as it's executed, helping you identify where the loop is exiting unexpectedly.

The issue arises because of how ssh and the shell handle standard input (stdin) in combination with the while loop. Let me break this down step by step:

1. Understanding while read
The while read loop reads lines from a file (machines.txt) via standard input (stdin). Here's a simplified breakdown:

The shell opens the file machines.txt and assigns it to the stdin of the loop.
Each line of the file is read into variables (IP, FQDN, etc.).
The loop processes one line at a time until the end of the file.
2. How ssh Affects stdin
When you run ssh, it also uses stdin by default. This behavior is what causes the issue. Let’s analyze:

a. Default ssh Behavior
When ssh is executed, it tries to use stdin for two purposes:

To accept input for commands on the remote machine.
To handle any interactive prompts, such as password authentication (if keys aren’t used).
b. Conflict with the while Loop
When ssh runs in the loop, it inherits the same stdin as the while loop (machines.txt). Here’s what happens:

ssh starts executing.
Since ssh uses the same stdin as the loop, it reads from the file machines.txt.
ssh consumes additional lines from stdin, which are meant for the while loop.
As a result, the while loop no longer has any lines to process after the first iteration, and it terminates.
3. Example of the Issue
Suppose machines.txt contains:

text
Copy code
192.168.1.1 example1 host1 subnet1
192.168.1.2 example2 host2 subnet2
In your original code:

bash
Copy code
while read IP FQDN HOST SUBNET; do
    ssh -i azure-devops.pem admin@${IP} sudo uname -o -m
done < ./kubernetes-the-hard-way/machines.txt
Here’s what happens:

The loop reads the first line (192.168.1.1 example1 host1 subnet1) and assigns it to the variables.
ssh starts for 192.168.1.1, but it also reads the next line (192.168.1.2 ...) from stdin, consuming it.
The while loop now sees the end of the file (EOF) because ssh has already consumed the second line.
The loop exits after processing only the first host.
4. Solution: Redirect stdin
By redirecting ssh's stdin to /dev/null, we ensure ssh doesn’t interfere with the while loop’s input. /dev/null acts as a "black hole" for input — anything sent to it is discarded.

Updated code:

bash
Copy code
while read IP FQDN HOST SUBNET; do
    ssh -i azure-devops.pem admin@${IP} sudo uname -o -m </dev/null
done < ./kubernetes-the-hard-way/machines.txt
Now:

The while loop exclusively reads from machines.txt.
ssh gets its input from /dev/null instead of machines.txt.
Each line of the file is processed as intended.
5. Why Does This Only Happen in Loops?
When you run ssh outside of a loop, there’s no file being read as stdin, so ssh doesn’t conflict with anything. In a loop, stdin is already in use by read, and ssh inadvertently competes for the same resource.

6. Key Takeaways
ssh consumes stdin if not redirected, which can interfere with scripts using stdin for other purposes.
Redirecting ssh’s stdin to /dev/null prevents conflicts.
Always be mindful of input/output redirection when combining commands in scripts.
If you’d like, I can provide additional examples or clarifications!

is there any way possible to see which process is using stdin so that I can have visually see while loop and ssh using same stdin

Yes, you can inspect the standard input (stdin) usage of processes by leveraging tools like strace or lsof. These tools can show how processes interact with file descriptors, including stdin. Here's how you can observe it in action:

1. Understanding File Descriptors
File descriptor 0 represents stdin.
File descriptor 1 is stdout.
File descriptor 2 is stderr.
When a process opens a file or uses stdin, the file descriptor 0 is associated with that resource.

2. Using strace to Trace File Descriptor Activity
strace traces system calls and signals. You can use it to see how ssh and the while loop interact with stdin.

Steps:
Run your script with strace and redirect output to a log file:

bash
Copy code
strace -f -e trace=open,read ./your-script.sh > strace.log 2>&1
-f: Follows child processes (like ssh).
-e trace=open,read: Focuses on open and read system calls.
Look at the output in strace.log. You'll see something like this:

scss
Copy code
[pid] open("machines.txt", O_RDONLY) = 3
[pid] read(3, "192.168.1.1 example1 host1 subnet1\n", 4096) = ...
[pid] read(0, "192.168.1.2 example2 host2 subnet2\n", 4096) = ...
This shows the read calls from file descriptor 3 (file machines.txt) and file descriptor 0 (stdin).
If ssh starts consuming input, you’ll see read calls associated with it using file descriptor 0.

3. Using lsof to Inspect Open Files
lsof lists open files for running processes, including their stdin.

Steps:
Run your script and, in a separate terminal, observe file usage with lsof:

bash
Copy code
lsof -p <PID>
Replace <PID> with the process ID of your script or the ssh command.

Look at the file descriptors. For example:

yaml
Copy code
COMMAND   PID   USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
bash      1234  admin  0r   REG  8,1     1024    5678 /home/admin/machines.txt
ssh       1235  admin  0r   CHR  1,3     0t0       3 /dev/tty
The bash process (loop) uses file descriptor 0 (/home/admin/machines.txt).
The ssh process also tries to use stdin (e.g., /dev/tty), which may cause conflicts.
Observing in Real-Time:
Use lsof in a loop to watch changes in open files:

bash
Copy code
watch -n 0.5 'lsof -p <PID>'
4. A Practical Experiment
You can demonstrate the conflict by making a simple script that shows stdin usage in the loop and inside ssh.

Script:
bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
while read IP; do
    echo "Reading for $IP from stdin..."
    ssh -oBatchMode=yes admin@$IP "cat -" </dev/null
done < machines.txt
Observe the behavior with and without redirecting ssh’s stdin.

5. Debugging with /proc Filesystem
Linux exposes process file descriptors in /proc/<PID>/fd.

Steps:
Find the process ID of the script or ssh:

bash
Copy code
ps aux | grep 'your-script.sh'
Look at the file descriptors:

bash
Copy code
ls -l /proc/<PID>/fd
Observe what stdin (fd 0) points to:

javascript
Copy code
lrwx------ 1 admin admin 64 Dec 24 13:00 0 -> /home/admin/machines.txt
If ssh is running, check its file descriptors similarly.

Key Observations
strace shows exactly which system calls (read or open) are made and on which file descriptor.
lsof or /proc/<PID>/fd provides a snapshot of which files are currently opened by processes.
The conflict arises because both the loop and ssh are competing to read from the same file descriptor (stdin).
